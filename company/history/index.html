<p>In 2016 we made a clean break with Ruby, and the Object Oriented
paradigm, and transitioned to <a href="https://www.elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> for its functional and
immutable style, strong foundation of the BEAM, and an expressivity
that dramatically enhances productivity, safety and durability. The
Phoenix framework and Ecto with Postgresql alone have enabled the
craftsmanship we truly appreciate and has reinforced the transition to
Elixir, and that’s naming merely two!</p>

<p>In the same period, <a href="https://reactjs.org">React.js</a> and <a href="https://react-native.org">React native</a> coupled with GraphQL
(via Absinthe and Apollo) have become the mainstay for front-end
work. While our focus is server side, front-end is always a part of
the mix.</p>

<p>In 2012 we moved away from Mercurial to GIT and have not looked
back. Mercurial was a great improvement over CVS, but its time is past
also. Github has become a default platform for hosted GIT and more
specifically code review, but we also like Gerrit for a more technical
and GIT-centric approach.</p>

<p>Our approach to testing is an exercise in pragmatics. A lot of time
can be spent writing tests, some that are truly invaluable and some
that are repeatedly thrown away as things change. The priority is to
maximize the former and minimize the latter. Thus, we tend to use TDD
for expressing requirements when that’s valuable, but let them go if
they become irrelevant. Testing is most important when the data and
interaction is just complex enough to not be apparent, or when the
edge cases are cutting. Thanks to Elixir and ExUnit, we’ve developed
some excellent ways of testing, in terms of contracts, cross module
test support, and Ecto Sandboxing. With the addition of dialyzer,
Elixir really has us covered.</p>

<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>

<p>Taking a pragmatic approach to deployment, one based on the expertise
on-hand and long term is an important balance. Containers from
development through deployment are keys to success. Combine that with
CDK and AWS/ECS and it is a formula that can work for even small teams
with limited DevOps bandwidth.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>

<p>It is easy to neglect this category for a startup, but it becomes a
friction point and an expense if left so. From an early stage startup,
we like including Atlassian’s Confluence and JIRA to create an
organizational memory and to manage development. There are good
alternatives just as long as the two basic functions are handled.</p>

<p>Beyond that point there are countless efforts we have undertaken to
coordinate resources and provide better central management. These
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cloud VMs for development</li>
  <li>Directory services, i.e. AD</li>
  <li>SSL management</li>
  <li>Security and firewalls</li>
  <li>Gerrit</li>
  <li>LAN infrastructure and services</li>
</ul>
