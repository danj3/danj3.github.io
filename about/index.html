  <div class="post-content">
    <p>The articles here are about discoveries made, lessons learned, and
topics explored. Were there enough time there would be much more. So
as time allows, there is an inconsistent cadence of new articles. But
the objective is the same, to share working solutions or a point of
view that may help others.</p>

<h2 id="a-story-of-why">A story of why</h2>

<p>Information can be so easily found by search engine that you (and I)
may question the value of writing more about anything. But then a
funny thing happened.</p>

<p>I had a Kerberos problem and searched using the messages and details I
had at hand.  One of the search results looked promising, only to
discover that I’d written the post (here) about the very problem I had
(again). I had solved the problem, posted and forgot enough about it
to discover in the future a solution I’d already written about.</p>

<p>Search engines miss a lot. There are unique paths to problems the
don’t score well.  Some content is behind subscriptions. Other content
is either practically inaccessible or just lost.  However, even in
cases where a single search and click provides answers, finding those
answer again is not assured. If I am the constant in these problems,
then my own record of the solutions is more probably of use than might
be initially apparent.</p>

<h2 id="technology-is-a-modern-requirement">Technology is a modern requirement</h2>

<p>Technology and the global market economy are deeply
interdependent. Technology and innovation are the source of gains in
productivity for economic growth. There is no steady state in the
economy and so there is always demand for new technology. Simply,
economic growth demands technology growth. Success for people,
companies, and nations is largely dependent on their ability to
innovate.</p>

<h2 id="about-triskelion-llc">About Triskelion, LLC</h2>

<p>The company was <a href="/about/founding">founded</a> to build an <a href="/about/strand">E-Commerce
site for Strand Book Store</a>. There were subsequent periods of
contract work under the Triskelion, LLC banner and staff positions.
Work includes software development, system design, team and product
management, system and network administration. With work in retail
books, program trading, social media, fin-tech, internet MSO, grass
roots action and engagement.</p>

<p>Software development since 2016 has been entirely with
<a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> and the great flexibility and
productivity it provides. We support the <a href="https://erlef.org">Erlang Ecosystem
Foundation</a> and the objective of building
the next generation of advanced, reliable, realtime applications.</p>

<h2 id="work-history">Work History</h2>

<h3 id="cinemagram">Cinemagram</h3>
<p>We built the mobile cinemagram editor and short form video social media platform
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/2/9/2787212/cinemagram-app-store-cinemagraph-kinotopic">Cinemagram</a>
for
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/cinemagram-android-review/">Android</a> and
<a href="https://cinemagram.en.softonic.com/iphone">iPhone</a>. This was the
original short form video social media app. Unfortunately twitter ate
our lunch with Vine which forced us to pivot. We launched <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/what-could-possibly-go-wrong-with-yeti">Yeti Campus
Stories</a>. It
did succumb to the moderation problem at which point we started
working on machine learning approaches to the problem. This was 2016
and it really was ML, gradient descent and all. It was promising, but
we ran out of runway.</p>

<p>At the end of this period I picked up
<a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> and found answers that I had been
looking for during the decade plus of work with Ruby.</p>

<h3 id="exeq">exeq</h3>

<p>I joined <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/exeq">exeq</a>
in 2016. A <a href="https://medium.com/exeq">fin-tech</a> firm operating in New
York and a full stack of Elixir, GraphQL, and React. The integration
with <a href="https://plaid.com">plaid</a> was the primary data feed integration.
The Elixir
<a href="https://medium.com/exeq/of-paris-goats-remotely-building-a-tech-team-76d42d91fd7c">team</a>
was about five and we were productive with Elixir.
We didn’t get to that scaling event and run out of runway.</p>

<h3 id="strand-book-store">Strand Book Store</h3>

<p>During <a href="/about/strand">multiple periods</a>, work for Strand has been
focused on building and supporting the E-commerce evolution of
sites. Starting with PHP, graduating to Ruby, rebuilding in
Elixir. Book selling is a unique and challenging retail business on
all fronts. Integration with <a href="https://basilsoftware.com">Basil</a> for
the brick and mortar part. Integration with
<a href="https://www.ingramcontent.com/retailers/products">Ingram</a> for broader
new content, metadata, and digital assets. In the current incarnation,
bridging between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magento">Magento</a>
front-end site and Basil processing multiple source catalog update
streams and order/payment/shipping integration over
<a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a>.</p>

<h3 id="breezeline">Breezeline</h3>

<p>Starting in 2020, building an Elixir team from scratch to bring
in-house new integrations. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TiVo provisioning</li>
  <li>identity management and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single sign-on</a></li>
  <li>customer self service</li>
  <li>mobile provisioning</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.plume.com/homepass">home wireless provisioning</a></li>
  <li>outage reporting</li>
  <li>email provider integration</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Everywhere">TV Everywhere</a> authorization</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.servicenow.com">support CRM</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The core of these integrations leverage the reliability and
distributed features of Elixir to tie together
<a href="https://www.csgi.com">CSG</a> technology used by the company via ENI and
SLBOS to create flexible, responsive and real-time propagation of
events and actions.</p>

<p>Extensive use of <a href="https://absinthe-graphql.org">graphQL</a> provided a
consistent well documented data and operational boundary allowing
front-end and back-end development to be independently productive.</p>
